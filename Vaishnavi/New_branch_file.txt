Python Variables
Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values.
________________________________________
Creating Variables: Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
Eg:      x =5
          Print(x)
Casting: If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
X= str(x)
Get the Type:You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Eg: x = 5
Print(type(x))
### Rules to define the variable name ####
 1. Can not contains space in variable name.
 var1 = 567 # correct
var 123 = 700 # incorrect
2. Variable name should not start with number
# var567 = 90000 # correct
# 23x = 500 # incorrect
3. There is no limit for variable name, you can define any long name.
# we_are_learning_python_programming = 'Python Programing' # correct
# m = 800  # correct
 4. Variable names are case-sensitive.
name = 'Rahul'
Name = 'Mohan'
NAME = 'Raghav'
NAMe = 'Pratik'
print(name, NAME, Name, NAMe)
# Rahul Raghav Mohan Pratik
5. Variable name can not contain special characters except underscore
# var$abc = 'Hello'  # incorrect
var_abc_hello = 'Python'  # correct
Multiple assignment:
Eg1: x=y=z=20
