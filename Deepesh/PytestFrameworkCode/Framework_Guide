Types of Automation Framework
1. Linear Framework :  data/locator/selenium code everything is one single file, is called linear framework
2. Module Framework : In this framework user will design some re-usable module functions, that can reduce code redundancy.
3. Data Driven Framework : When we read data from external file then it is called data driven framework.
4. Keyword Driven Framework:  In this user will design some re-usage keyword, that can use n number of time.
                              e.g.  Robotframework is purely keyword driven framework

5. Hybrid Framework : Hybrid framework is combination all other possible framework.
6. BDD Framework : In this framework , tool will decide the action as the user behaviour in feature file. (Cucumber, Behave)


POM (Page Object Model) :  POM is design patter of the class structure.
                           ->  In POM for each page of website, will create a separate file, that we can specifically contains
                               method belongs to that page on the website.


# We will the design the framework with below combination.
Pytest + Hybrid + POM
