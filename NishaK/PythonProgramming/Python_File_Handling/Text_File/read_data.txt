rEADABILITY:
pYTHON'S SYNTAX EMPHASIZES CODE CLARITY AND USES INDENTATION TO DEFINE CODE BLOCKS, MAKING IT EASIER TO READ AND UNDERSTAND.
vERSATILITY:
pYTHON CAN BE USED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING WEB DEVELOPMENT (WITH FRAMEWORKS LIKE dJANGO AND fLASK), DATA SCIENCE (WITH LIBRARIES LIKE pANDAS AND nUMpY), AND MACHINE LEARNING (WITH tENSORfLOW AND SCIKIT-LEARN).
iNTERPRETED lANGUAGE:
pYTHON CODE IS EXECUTED BY AN INTERPRETER, ALLOWING FOR FASTER DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AS CODE CAN BE RUN IMMEDIATELY AFTER WRITING IT.
oBJECT-oRIENTED AND fUNCTIONAL:
pYTHON SUPPORTS BOTH OBJECT-ORIENTED AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS, GIVING DEVELOPERS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY STRUCTURE THEIR CODE.
lARGE sTANDARD lIBRARY:
pYTHON COMES WITH A COMPREHENSIVE STANDARD LIBRARY THAT PROVIDES PRE-BUILT MODULES AND FUNCTIONS, REDUCING THE NEED TO WRITE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH.
dYNAMIC tYPING:
pYTHON IS DYNAMICALLY TYPED, MEANING THAT VARIABLE TYPES ARE CHECKED DURING RUNTIME, NOT DURING COMPILATION.
cROSS-pLATFORM:
pYTHON RUNS ON VARIOUS OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING wINDOWS, MACos, AND lINUX.
